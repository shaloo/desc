API Reference Guide
*********************

This guide provides comprehensive list of Puttshack Cloud REST APIs.

These APIs are meant for Puttshack IT Team and Developers. Using these APIs, they can create newer Puttshack web applications and mobile services for Puttshack customers.

Besides that, these APIs can also be used (in future) for generating analytics and reports that could be useful for Puttshack executives.

Here is an example Puttshack API (Openapi v3.0.0) layout - see :ref:`here<docref_openapi_layout>`.

Here is how openapi/swagger v2 layout happens correctly - see :ref:`here<docref_petstore_v2>`.

Here is an alternative API layout used by some organizations - also used by Chris on GitHub deployment. We need to pick up one that works for Puttshack / descriptive.

Developer Notes

.. note::

     Work in Progress
     This section will contain (if applicable for descriptive)
     
     * Developer information
     *  and instruction on API usage / caveats if any etc.

     Need to discuss this with Descriptive team to figure out what they'd like besides the bare bones API reference auto generated.
